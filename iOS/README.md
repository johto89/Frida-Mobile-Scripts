## Executing Frida Scripts

If you try to run the scripts as a file from command line (```frida -U -p 1234 -l test_script.js```) then it will get terminated if execution time exceeds 28 seconds.

I recommend attaching to the target app's process and then pasting the Frida script code you want to execute.

Some scripts are defined as functions. You can directly use the code and call the functions by supplying correct arguments to the function call.

You can also utilize the Python script for executing the Frida script code.
